When would you want to creat a remote reposity rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to copy the reposity from others

I want to push the change manually rather than automatically cause I don't want my version be published before I solve all the bug.

fork is the method for copy the reposity to my github online profile;
clone is the method for copy from online to lokal;
branch is to make new branch of version.
