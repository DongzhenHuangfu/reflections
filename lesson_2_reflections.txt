When I initialise the version properties, it will creat a file named .git, which can record the change I made for the tracked files, in this way, I can do the version control.

staging area is a place you combine the relevant files together, so that you can commit them together.
Working area is the place you are working on.
Version base is where you save your versions

Every time I make a logical change, I should do the followings:
1. use git diff to make sure I doing exactly what I want
2. use git add +filename to add it in the staging area
3. use git diff --staged to make sure I am commiting exactly what I want
4. use git commit to commit it.

When I want to do a different version and the origin one is also useful, I can make a branch, which will be mauch more easier to switch between useful versions and the name of each branch will help me to understand which part of this version is special.

By using the graph I can get a visual information abou t the branch I made, and also, which commit is reachable and which is not.
